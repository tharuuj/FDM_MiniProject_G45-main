Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunications

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a Random Forest model. By analyzing various customer features such as demographics, transaction history, and service usage patterns, the model effectively identifies customers who are likely to discontinue using the company's services. The Random Forest algorithm enhances prediction accuracy through its ensemble approach, allowing for a robust assessment of churn probabilities.
